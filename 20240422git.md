prepare the git environment 

  In VScode, before commit: 
    git config --global user.email "pascal1982@sina.com"
    git config --global user.name "pascal19821003"

  when push for the first time, vscode opens  a prompt asking me how login github
    choose a browser to login.
    after logging in, close the browser tab and return to vscode.
    you will see it has been pushed.
 

  merge code: 
    in vscode, switch to an old branch. Then navigate to branch>merge> choose a new branch, and it will be merged.
